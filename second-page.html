    <h2>My opinion of the verse</h2>
    <p>I think that the verse is interesting because of the way that it dramatizes some of the smaller aspects of being in exile: how things taste and what you think about while you're just going up and down the stairs.</p>
    <p>I first read this passage while I was in Italy, and tasted some of the bread from Dante's homeland. It didn't taste salty at all! So the idea that even bread, the most basic food staple, feels just slightly off, really captures how a sense of exile permeates one's entire life.</p>
